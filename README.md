# Angular with Express

I built a full-stack Book Application in that:

- Book has id, title, description, published status.
- User can create, retrieve, update, delete Books.
- There is a search box for finding Books by title.

## Project setup

### Node.js Server

```
cd node-server
npm run start
```

### Angular Client

```
cd angular-client
npm run start
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

Or to run it on specific port, Run `ng serve --port 8081`, and navigate to `http://localhost:8081/`.
